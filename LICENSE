ntf-buffer is licensed by the NTF License (totally not made up)

You can do anything with it (sell,distribute,modify and other things). If you fuck something up, that's your fault, not mine. If you use this project or made changes to it, you need to create a file within the distribution that includes the following text:

    <author> is so cool, he uses ntf-buffer and probably doesn't cause chaos with it!
    You want to use ntf-buffer, too? Then go to https://github.com/N1ghtTheF0x/cpp-buffer!

If that file does not exist, I will personally contact you somehow and tell you, what kind of asshole you are (not really like that but somewhat close to it). This also includes not having the structure of the text. The name of that file is choosen by you, but has to be at least in the top directory ore ONE subdirectory. This license also has to be included with the others
